BLAAHHh U LET ME INTO uR HaUs.  Thx

...Plebian :octocat: 

Delta36, you plebian you! You and your commoner ways have slowed down our project tremendously with your faulty coding ways, and we need now to commit triage and eliminate you from the equation. I hope you do not have a good day; bad bye.

"Commit Triage", we've barely been using GitHub for a month and you're already making puns you crazy.  And plus some famous old man once said "The plebians shall inherit the Earth" (NOT paraphrasing)

We dedicate this line to our first casualty of code; the Joe branch.  It shall forever be remember for its clever witiness, its invention of phillium, and for its tragic corruption and death in the experiment of doom. ;n;  Hopefully it is spared from the dark arts of necromancy *cough* *cough* Matthew... *cough* *cough* | (•\n/•) |
