NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER MERGE THE MASTER INTO ANYTHING
if you need a new copy, delete your old branch and make a new one off the master 

BLAAHHh U LET ME INTO uR HaUs.  Thx

...Plebian :octocat: 

Delta36, you plebian you! You and your commoner ways have slowed down our project tremendously with your faulty coding ways, and we need now to commit triage and eliminate you from the equation. I hope you do not have a good day; bad bye.

"Commit Triage", we've barely been using GitHub for a month and you're already making puns you crazy.  And plus some famous old man once said "The plebians shall inherit the Earth" (NOT paraphrasing)

We dedicate this line to our first casualty of code; the Joe branch.  It shall forever be remember for its clever witiness, its invention of phillium, and for its tragic corruption and death in the experiment of doom. ;n;  Hopefully it is spared from the dark arts of necromancy *cough* *cough* Matthew... *cough* *cough* | (•\n/•) |

Nice try you fiend! My necromancy and resurection stats have been maxed out already (and are clearly over 9000)!  Through the sheer power of will, I have broken this universe's code, producing unprecedentedly high levels that you can never hope to match!

Twidles thumbs in a corner slowly plotting the overthrow of his superiors *cough* *cough* Joe.. *cough* *cough* 
      and maybe Matthew *cough* *cough*
     
and he slowly peices together his stargate portal in order to conquer new lands for himself...

joe.physicsBody.velocity = CGVectorMake(100, 10000);

*joe flys away at near the speed of sound*
BWA HA HA I have rid us of that monstrosity

It's "flies" not "flys" you ninny!

But I survived.  We may have to punish you for this.  You shall perish in flames!!! :fire:
