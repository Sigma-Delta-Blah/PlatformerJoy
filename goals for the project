things to work on
MAKE TILE MAP READ FROM A TEXT FILE!!!



in any particular order
anyone may edit this (but only to add goals)
1. fix the wierd deadzone on the touchscreen?
2. Have TileMapData be able to read from a text file

It's far to early for any of these things
3.start designing art for game and implementing it
4.animations?
5.SOUNDS!!!  but get sources for it so we dont get into legal trouble
6.make art for tiles and implement them properly
7.make 2d arrays of tile configurations
8.program an enemy and make it spawn (doesnt have to do much)
9.make projectiles?
